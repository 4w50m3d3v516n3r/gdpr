Hi,

My personal data, like my email address, are protected under GDPR law since may 2016
	http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/

As the article 3 say, all GDPR law apply to you because I'm an UE citizen, even if your company is outside the UE.

As the article 15 says, I have the right to ask you to provide to me all personal datas you have about myself, the purpose of the processing, why and how you collect them, if you share my data with others people or countries, etc

As the article 7 says, I ask you to prove to me I have consented to my data to be collected and processed.

As the article 12 says, you have 1 month to fullfill my request, after that I will open a case to the UE regulator.

I also want all my personal data to be destroyed from your database or other storage (including backup). **But only after you provide me informations requested above.**

Regards,
